Description: Implementation of the categorical instrumental variable (CIV) 
    estimator proposed by Wiemann (2023) <arXiv:2311.17021>. CIV allows for optimal instrumental 
    variable estimation in settings with relatively few observations per 
    category. To obtain valid inference in these challenging settings, CIV
    leverages a regularization assumption that implies existence of a latent 
    categorical variable with fixed finite support achieving the same first 
    stage fit as the observed instrument.
