Asymptotic properties CIV estimator follow first-stage mapping can estimated sufficient rate. Wiemann (2023) provides sufficient conditions estimation mapping exponential rate using K-Conditional-Means (KCMeans) estimator. proposed KCMeans estimator exact computes quickly time polynomial number observed categories, thus avoiding heuristic solution approaches otherwise associated KMeans-type problems. See also kcmeans R package additional details. considered data generating process, underlying optimal instrument Z0 two support points. first step, CIV attempts map values observed instrument support points. code snippet shows largely succeeds : Among 800 observations, 16 observations missclassified.
